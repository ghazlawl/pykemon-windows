# Pyk√©mon (Windows)

A Python script that automates boring tasks like battling pok√©mon, catching pok√©mon, and fishing. For now it only works with [Pok√©mon Platinum](https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_platinum) using the [DeSmuME](https://desmume.org/) emulator for Windows.

I don't know why I made this. It took me longer to make than it would to play the game myself. Anyway, enjoy!

## Images

Here are some images of the script in action. Wow!

### Patrolling üö∂

Here you can see the character auto-patrolling high grass in search of pok√©mon.

### Battling ‚öîÔ∏è

Here you can see the character auto-battling a pok√©mon. If the pok√©mon hasn't already been caught the character will automatically throw pok√©balls.

### Fishing üé£

Here you can see the character auto-fishing. This is the most boring activity but it is great for farming Magikarp to level up low-level pok√©mon.

This Magikarp will make a fine Gyarados one day.

## Commands

### Activate the virtual environment:

```
.\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

### Start Patrolling:

This command will have the character patrol a small area, left and right, in search of pok√©mon. Once a pok√©mon is found the character will either catch it or defeat it. After each battle the character will resume the patrol.

```
python .\pykemon.py patrol
```

### Start Fishing:

This command will have the character start fishing. Once a pok√©mon is hooked the character will either catch it or defeat it. After each battle the character will resume fishing.

```
python .\pykemon.py fish
```

### Start/Continue Battle:

This command is useful if you have already started battling a pok√©mon and you want the script to take over.

```
python .\pykemon.py battle
```

### Reset Keys:

This command is useful if you exit the script while a key is being pressed and it get "stuck".

```
python .\pykemon.py reset
```
